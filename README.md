## Outside-Assignment

This project is built as part of an trainee assignment for Outside. It focuses on creating a responsive, accessible web page using semantic HTML and modular CSS, meeting the  modern development standards. 

The design ensures cross-device compatibility with the use of CSS resets and follows the DRY principle by utilizing reusable styles via CSS variables or SCSS. The first section of the web page is designed with a height based on the viewport to create a dynamic layout.

For data fetching, a JSON dummy API is used to retrieve and display dynamic content on the page. This approach demonstrates the ability to work with external data sources and integrate them seamlessly into the frontend. The fetched data is used to populate various sections of the page, ensuring that content is up-to-date and relevant. All code and progress will be tracked using Git, with feature branches for different sections and squashed commits to ensure clean, organized commit history. The project will be hosted on Github.
