## Outside-Assignment

This project is built as part of an trainee assignment for Outside. It focuses on creating a responsive, accessible web page using semantic HTML and modular CSS, meeting the  modern development standards. 

The design ensures cross-device compatibility with the use of CSS resets and follows the DRY principle by utilizing reusable styles via CSS variables or SCSS. The first section of the web page is designed with a height based on the viewport to create a dynamic layout.

For the backend, the solution will be added in the upcoming commits. All code and progress will be tracked using Git, with feature branches for different sections and squashed commits to ensure clean, organized commit history. The project will be hosted on Github.
