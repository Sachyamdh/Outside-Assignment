## Outside-Assignment

This project is built as part of a trainee assignment for Outside. It focuses on creating a responsive, accessible web page using semantic HTML and modular CSS, meeting modern development standards.

The design ensures cross-device compatibility with the use of CSS resets and follows the DRY principle by utilizing reusable styles via CSS variables. The first section of the web page is designed with a height based on the viewport to create a dynamic layout. The overall structure is simple, illustrating the ability to handle dynamic content, API integration, and providing a clean, easy-to-set-up layout for further development.

For data fetching, a JSON dummy API is used to retrieve and display dynamic content on the page. This approach demonstrates the ability to work with external data sources and integrate them seamlessly into the frontend. The fetched data is used to populate various sections of the page, ensuring that content is up-to-date and relevant.

One of the key interactive features of this project involves a video section where videos are dynamically loaded from Youtube . While the assignment required disabling other video play options when one video is playing, this was not fully implemented. However, the current implementation demonstrates how video playback can be handled dynamically with options for further refinement.

All code and progress was tracked using Git, with feature branches for different sections and squashed commits to ensure clean, organized commit history. The project will be hosted on GitHub.
